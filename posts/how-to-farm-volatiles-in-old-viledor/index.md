So,  we all have been there. Too weak to fight against a plethora of volatiles that has been present in the patch 1.11. Now a days you can't even stroll outside in the night without running into volatiles.

So in order to get stronger, you need to get more volatiles. 
In order to beat volatiles, you need to get stronger.

Here's the problem. These issues are cyclic. 


So here's how i figured out the best strategy for farming volatiles early in the game.

# First go to Cillian's house

If you want to be extra sure, go there in daylight.

# Open the back door

Open the back door in such a position that you can close it in pressure

# Start Resting

Rest until nighttime

# Lure a volatile

There are a couple of volatiles roaming nearby. Just shine your flashlight at them and they will start chasing you. 

Once they start chasing you, lure them into Cillian's house. 

When they are inside. Just close the door and let the UV light shine.
