Today ( well not really, this was written in 12-13-2023 at 10:54 ) is the day I retire my [Bloody B820r](https://www.bloody.com/en/product.php?pid=11&id=154) keyboard, farewell comrade, for you have been loyal to me from 2019 ( 4 years on this keyboard, this is awesome )

Here's how it looks :

Without keycaps | Note that the spacebar key is broken, it has been like this for a while ( 2 years i guess )

# Why did I change
Inspite of the fact that bloody claims that their switches are rated for [100 million clicks](https://www.bloody.pl/lightstrike-2/) ( twice the amount of cherry mx ), it didn't last even 5 million clicks ( shocking! ). It's a obvious marketing tactic. 

Their manufracturing quality is sub-par compared to corsair and cherry. From regular usage, I could tell which keys I used more than others due to different tactile feedback I got from them ( this shouldn't be the case, atleast not on 4 year occasional usage ). Coupled with the fact that the spacebar key broke, yes the actualy switch broke from inside, again sign of cheap Chinese manufracturing quality.

Their LED are not the strongest point, my LED started malfunctioning after about 2 years of daily usage ( right after the warrenty period, again this is how these cheap chinese clone companies are able to stay afloat ).


Other than sub-par manufracturing quality, one of the keys died on me. Yes, the actual light sensor died about 4 months back. Making my right shift unusable. Again with moderate usage, this shouldnot be the case. ( WTF )


# So would I Recommend this to another person

Despite how annoyed I sound, I absolutely loved the keyboard. It was 60$ when I bought it brand new. Back in 2019,it was a good keyboard but now there are far better alternative in the market ( specially where I live ). At 60$ you can get a hotswappable ( with cherry mx style switches ) keyboard.

I would suggest this keyboard only if:
- You want a full sized keyboard.
- You want a keyboard that will last you about 2-3 years.
- You are okay with not being able to hotswap switch ( technically you can hotswap, but good luck finding one )
- You bought into their LightStrike marketing.

Overall, we bought 2 keyboard, one for me and another for my friend. Mine died and my friend's one is still running. So your milage may vary on this.
