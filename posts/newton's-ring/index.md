So I always wondered how the Newton's Ring would look like. I even asked my Physics sir multiple times how it should look like but i was always detered by the Physics Lab Assistant. So low and behold on 10 September I finally got the chance to see the Newton's ring. But it was not what I was expecting,

The apparatus looked janky and uncleaned ( far from what I was expecting ). 

I also had another bad luck as I modified the lens position while I was experimenting, leading to mistakes ( and a bit of rant from my groupmates ).

Overall, I still am baffled that something this complex can be this small.
