I am a big Genshin Fan. I was introduced to this game by Rebel Rox ( one of my closest friend | I call him cat because he simps for [`Keqing`](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Keqing) ). Someday after my first exam in Class 11 ( I failed at that exam spectacularly ) Rebel Rox asked me whats my Genshin Impact uid? I previously lied to him, that I have had a Genshin account ( to get closer to him ). But at that point there was no lying anymore. I hopped onto my PC and I made a new account. Almost right away I fell in love with that game ( as someone with very few friends back then, the game was my only way to pass time ).

Day by day I was more addicted to Genshin. With my sole goal being to overthrow Rebel Rox's Adventure Rank someday. But thats a story for another day.

# Where I came to learn about Honeyworks

So after playing Genshin I was delving deeper into it's fanfiction and stuff. One of the more popular fan-fic was the Diluc and Jean ship. So suddenly a Youtube video popped into my daily feed. It was this video :

I really liked the words in the songs ( as someday I dream to have a wife like that **≧◡≦** )

So I started researcing about HoneyWorks ( and listening to more of their songs ) and fast forward 2 years almost all of my songs that I listen to daily are from HoneyWorks.
